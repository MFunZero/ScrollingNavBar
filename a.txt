RubyGems installed the following executables:
	/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/bin/gem

Ruby Interactive (ri) documentation was installed. ri is kind of like man 
pages for ruby libraries. You may access it like this:
  ri Classname
  ri Classname.class_method
  ri Classname#instance_method
If you do not wish to install this documentation in the future, use the
--no-document flag, or set it as the default in your ~/.gemrc file. See
'gem help env' for details.
